Sponge is a basic web frontend to Pulp (http://www.pulpproject.org).
It is based around the workflow described at
http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa11/tech/full_papers/Pierre.pdf
(currently requires a login; to be public shortly.)

Sponge runs on Django, using Pulp (of course) and Celery.

Sponge includes code from:

  * jQuery (http://jquery.org)
  * jQuery Tablesorter (http://tablesorter.com)
  * jQuery Quicksearch (https://github.com/riklomas/quicksearch)
