Most of the software involved in the approach discussed in this paper
is free and open source.  The various elements of our solution can be
found at:

\item[Bcfg2] \url{http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2}
\item[Yum] \url{http://yum.baseurl.org/}
\end{description}

Sponge, the web UI to Pulp listed in the Future Development section,
is currently incomplete and unreleased.  We have already worked
closely with the Pulp developers to incorporate features into the Pulp
core itself, and we will continue to do so.  We hope that Sponge will
become unnecessary as Pulp matures.
