This paper describes an approach for managing package versions and
updates in a homogenous manner across a heterogenous environment by
intensively managing a set of software repositories rather than by
managing the clients.  This entails maintaining multiple local
mirrors, each of which is aimed at a different class of client: One is
directly synchronized from the upstream repositories, while others are
maintained from that repository according to various policies that
specify which packages are to be automatically pulled from upstream
(and therefore automatically installed without any local vetting) and
which are to be considered more carefully -- likely installed in a
testing environment, for instance -- before they are deployed widely.
